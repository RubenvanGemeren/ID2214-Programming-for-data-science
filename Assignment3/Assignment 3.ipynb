    "By submitting this assignment, it is hereby declared that all group members listed above have contributed to the solution, either with code that appear in the final solution below, or with code that has been evaluated and compared to the final solution, but for some reason has been excluded. It is also declared that all project members fully understand all parts of the final solution and can explain it upon request.\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "All parts of the assignment starting with number 1 below are mandatory. Satisfactory solutions\n",
    "will give 1 point (in total). If they in addition are good (all parts work more or less \n",
    "as they should), completed on time (submitted before the deadline in Canvas) and according\n",

    "with number 2 below, then the assignment will receive 2 points (in total).\n",

    "Note that you do not have to develop the code directly within the notebook\n",
    "but may instead copy the comments and test cases to a more convenient development environment\n",
